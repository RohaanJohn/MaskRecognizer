# MaskRecognizer
A tensorflow project that detects whether a person in a photo (a jpg file) is wearing a mask or not. If wearing a mask the user will recieve an email stating that the person is wearing a mask and vice versa. Also you need to put in your email at your email in the code. Made during the Ingress Hackathon 2021 held by the CS department of MBCET.
